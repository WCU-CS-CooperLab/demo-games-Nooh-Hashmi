# Project 1 phase II game notes

## controls:
1. arrow keys to move
2. left Shift, Cost 20, power 1: magnet.
3. left Ctrl, Cost 100, power 2: extra life. 

## change 1:
For the first change I added an inert character that can be switched to. there are 2 playable characters that the player can enjoy. the first character is the regular fox. This character does not have any special features. it just runs around and collects coins. the second character is called Spender. 

Spender, as the name may suggest may spend some of the coins collected to activate some abilities. currently there are two abilities
1. Magnet. cost: 20 coins. click left shift to activate. after spending 20 coins the players radius to collect coins increases, coins from further away are easier to grab. only coins are picked up by the magnet. powerups are still needed to be claimed by the character. 

2. Extra life. cost: 100 coins. click left control to activate. by spending 100 coins your character gains an extra life. meaning you get to sustain one extra hit from a cactus up to however many lives you have gained. (at the moment there is no way to really see how many lives you have. I will update that later.)

## Change 2:
the second change is pretty simple. I have added 2 new powerups to the game, speed boost and destroy cacti

1. speed boost spawns once every 5-15 seconds. it increases the players movement speed. this one is a blue powerup.

2. destoy cacti, makes all the cacti on the level dissapear. this is a strong power up so its cooldown is a little unique. after the powerup gets picked up. the cooldown timer does not start untill you get the 2 levels after you pick up the power up. and then a cooldown timer of 10-20 seconds.
